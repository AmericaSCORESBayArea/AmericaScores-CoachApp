# Helping Scores Coaches Track Student Participation Everywhere
Scores partners with school districts as well as granting agencies and one of the important outcomes is to increase individual student participation in school and afterschool Scores activities.
Verifying and improving the program burdens coaches with the work of taking attendance, often at moments of transition from school, outside or in a new location, and often with new prospective students showing up for the first time on any given day.
Coaches needed help, so the Attendance App is intended to provide them more time focused on students and less time with bookkeeping.

The present reality of a scores coach is improvised paperwork that then has to be hand-entered into the Salesforce-based record system, later in the day. This is a big cost of quality coach time for both Students and Program.
